"2,929",Help me #keepmoving with an Alinker walking bike,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,26,"When I was diagnosed with Relapsing MS in 2002, my work was in
    the inside-front pages of top fashion magazines. I was the Art
    Director for Estée Lauder’s global advertising. Shortly, I was
    recruited by Starwood Hotels & Resorts where as Creative
    Director, I traveled the world, directing lifestyle and
    architectural photo shoots. MS symptoms have changed my abilities to do some of the things I
    love but my artistic vision and creative curiosity have only
    transitioned in new directions—a decade and a half after my first MS
    symptom I am writing and illustrating a children’s book, learning to
    horse back ride through equine therapy, swimming laps at the YMCA,
    tracing my Irish/French ancestry, blogging about cooking, recipes,
    collected during my travels and teaming with other creatives,
    developing marketing for non-profits—pro bono, like GallopNYC,
    therapeutic horsemanship. The Alinker is a non-motorized walking bike without pedals. I
    can continue to be active, be included and move around in a very
    cool way on the Alinker.",https://fundrazr.com/61TDS5

  life changing work the Guide Dogs do A dog is man’s best friend, so the saying goes, and the relationship
  between an owner and their guide dog runs even deeper. These dogs
  not only offer the usual qualities of companionship and loyalty, but
  act as the eyes for their blind or partially-blind owner, too. Over two million people in the UK are living with sight loss, and
  it’s estimated that every hour someone else will lose their
  sight. For many, this can lead to isolation and research has shown
  that over two thirds of those living with blindness lack confidence to
  join in everyday activities, and as many as 170,000 rarely leave home alone. So the work of Guide Dogs, CSMA Club’s charity partner, is vital and
  life-changing. Since its formation in 1931, the charity has
  trained and partnered over 30,000 guide dogs, transforming the lives
  of their owners. At the moment, there are 4700 guide dog partnerships

"2,800",Help Bre #keepmoving & maintain their independence with an Alinker walking bike!,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,35,"Hey friends! Okay, so... I'm Bre. I'm 28 years old. I'm a lover of the
    creative process and its many forms. I love trying new things
    because I'm always up for a good challenge. However, I'm facing a
    pretty big challenge of a different sort currently and would really
    appreciate your help. I've lived with mobility issues since the age of
    nine, because of multiple spinal issues, but mostly due to multiple
    arachnoid cysts filled with fluid at the base of my spine which are
    compressing my nerves. I've had surgery to drain it in 2001, and it
    was stable for many years but recent MRIs have shown that it's
    become filled with fluid once again. Medically, I'm figuring out
    what my options are at the moment. In October of 2015, I woke up to feeling like there was a
    piece of tape stuck to the bottom of my right foot. Since then I've
    had multiple EMGs and MRIs done and am still left with not a lot of
    answers or solutions. Due to a combination of my complicated case
    and the scar tissue from my previous surgery, multiple neurosurgeons
    have told me they're not comfortable attempting another... so I'm
    left with a situation I need to find my own solution for. To get an idea of what I'm working with here, here's a picture
    of a ""healthy"" spine vs my spine: If you feel like deciphering doctor language, here's my most
    recent MRI report: ( Right-click on the pic > Open image in new tab to see it at full resolution) In summation: YIKES. What does this mean for me currently? Chronic Pain Numbness in my right foot makes it so I can't
      feel the floor when I go to take a step, therefore, balance issues I haven't been able to walk without a cane
      since 2016 I'm not able to walk very far, even with a
      cane, so I've been essentially housebound for these last few
      years, and boy, would I love not to be! I'm reliant on my brother and sister-in-law
      for anything that requires me to leave the house. (They are the
      best and don't mind, but I'd rather not have to!) So... What would the Alinker do for me? I'd be able to leave the house by myself(!!!) I could go get the mail! Grocery stores would once again be within my reach Unlike a wheelchair, I'd be able to rebuild
      and maintain muscle tone in my legs Be able to have a conversation while walking
      again instead of using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall I could enjoy my time at events, festivals,
      family trips, etc. without feeling like I'm slowing everyone down Having a seat with me at all times would be a
      dream come true I could explore the neighborhood and all its
      cool historic sites I could take my nieces to the park I could walk the family dog I would be closer to being as cool as Selma Blair It really would give me so much freedom back,
      open up my world again, and change my life. Thank you for your consideration and support ♥",https://fundrazr.com/f1VtI8

  small group of health care workers whom are dedicated to improving
  lives of those less fortunate. In addition to assisting locally, we
  also travel to one of the poorest neighborhoods in Guatemala where we
  support The School of Hope  and Rekko Clinic. http://www.eftc.org.uk/our-work and http://www.rekko.org/index_en.html We are making our annual trip to Jocotenango, Guatemala in September
  2017.  We support a program that improves the lives of hundreds of
  improverished children. We cover our own travel and all associated
  expenses. We are asking you to help us raise funds for this school so
  that the children can obtain medical care at local clinics and
  hospitals. We continue to work with a local clinc and strengthen those
  ties. All funds go directly towards the cost of medical care. In 2016 fundraiser we raised $7,745.00, $1,235 more than the
  goal! The projected expenses for  medical care (including
  hospitalization, consults, labs, x-rays, scans, medicines,
  transportation, etc) for 2017 equates to $789.31 per month or $9471.73
  for the whole year. After we deducted the $1,235 ""excess"" we
  raised last year, the total goal for 2017 is $8,400. This puts us just past the financial goal. The reason for the increase in the budget this year is: The Quetzal has strengthened substantially compared to the
      USD, previously it was 7.75/1, now it is down to 7.3/1. Over the last year we have increased our numbers to 679
      students across the Foundation. On November 18, 2017 we are hosting a fundraiser at the Yakima Sports
  Center. We will be sharing our stories while hosting a silent auction,
  having a split the pot or 50/50 (winner took home almost $200 last
  year!) and games. Please help us with this fundraiser that will enable
  hundreds of impoverished children obtain access to healthcare. We support children and their future. People (specifically children)
  are the best investment. In order to improve a population you need
  empowerment and independence. The proven form has been education.
  These children face countless socioeconomic and psychological
  barriers. A holistic approach is required to improve longterm
  outcomes. What these children face on a near daily basis makes all of
  our life obstacles seem pity. The staff and volunteers provide long
  term commitment. They genuinely care and love the community in which
  they are empowering. They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long
  term and sustainable commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless
  these socioeconomic issues are resolved. If you are able, please help us and help spread the word. Any
  donation is greatly appreciated. These children are combating extreme
  poverty and many face inhuman conditions. This school provides a safe
  haven where they can break the cycle of poverty. All donations go

135,Help Patty With Double Lung Transplant Expenses,,,,,"Hi my name is Steve Olivieri I'm the pastor of Cornerstone Fellowship of Mill Run Who: I wanted to tell you about a sweet lady named
  I've gotten to know named Patty Brandt who
  really needs your help. What: Patty is on the waiting list for a double lung
  transplant! This is an incredible answer to prayer. Back Story: Patty Brandt has end stage severe
  Emphysema and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). For those
  of you who aren't medically minded, her lungs only work a fraction of
  how they're suppose to work. She has such a hard time breathing she
  needs on oxygen all day every day just to breath. Even while on oxygen
  she can only walk a short distance before she needs to stop and catch
  her breath. Patty underwent tons of tests and exams under the care of the Lung
  Transplant team of physicans at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in
  Pittsburgh, PA. She has been told she will be placed on the lung
  transplant list as long as she get some minor dental work and gains
  10lbs by December 1st. *She has been given the ok by the transplant team to begin
      fundraising to cover the cost of the transplant and follow-up care. Why is Patty fundraising? Isn't this type of thing covered by health Insurance? Even if you have insurance, there are out of pocket expenses
    associated with the transplanted and continued follow up care.
    Expenses include but are not limited to: Co-pays for medications and office visits (this
    alone will be $1,000's/month) Insurance premiums and deductibles Transportation costs and parking related costs Lodging and meals Even with Medicare, the out of pocket expenses related to getting a     double lung transplant will cost tens of thousands of dollars. Why consider helping Patty? Patty is not a perfect person and no one is, but there is one person
  who is rooting harder than anyone else for Patty. Her name is Kayla.
  She is the biological granddaughter of Patty and her husband Rick.
  Kayla's dad passed away and her mother was unable to care for Kayla.
  Not wanting to see their granddaughter enter into foster care, Patty
  and Rick legally adopted their granddaughter Kayla. They opened up
  their home and changed Kayla's life for the better. Patty made a promise to Kayla that she would see her through
  graduation if not longer. Why support Patty? So Patty can keep her promise to Kayla!! Please consider helping Patty pay their medical bills and continue to
  take care of thier granddaughter whom they love with their whole heart! This is where YOU come in: Give a one time tax
  deductible donation of $3, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 or whatever
  God tugs on your heart strings to give. *All donations are secure via paypal. 100% of the donated amount goes
  directly to Patty and her family to cover expenses related to her
  transplant and follow up care. If you have any questions or for more info: - Please email Pastor Steve Olivieri of Cornerstone

    specific cases received at the hospital, and we make sure this
    devices are given to the appropiate people, thanks to our

    current situation at this hospital. The information below has been
    retrieved from the following article: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/25/inside-venezuelas-top-childrens-medical-unit-where-patients-are/ “ This is dangerous for you and for me. There’s a real climate of
    fear”, says the doctor as he sits nervously in a room off intensive
    care at the JM de Los Rios Children’s Hospital in Caracas. Dr Huniades Urbina is trying to expose the desperate shortage of
    drugs and medical supplies in what should be the best equipped
    paediatric unit in Venezuela, but he is taking a great risk. Huge numbers of medicines are now hard or impossible to find,
    from antibiotics and painkillers to anti-epilepsy and chemotherapy drugs. D r Urbina says the unit has gone back to methods and medications
    used decades ago, because of the shortages. Where once they had
    state of the art chemotherapy for cancer patients he says they now
    have to make do with lesser options. “Sometimes people die because
    of these shortages, even here in the best children’s intensive care
    unit in Venezuela”, he says Testing kits for blood and other disposables are also scarce.
    The hospital has taken to boiling and reusing items that are
    supposed to be for single-use. When challenged on the dangers of
    this Dr Urbina’s junior colleague Dr Alvarez agrees but says they
    have no choice” The intensive care unit is operating with a reduced number of
    beds. That is partly due to the shortages of supplies, and also
    because of the shortage of doctors. Around 10,000 are estimated to
    have left the country in recent years. “ We do our best to help because this is what makes sense
      to do in cases like this.",https://fundrazr.com/jmdelosrios

"15,725",Ride to Give - Supporting Pray for Anna,U.S. Dollar,,of $15.7k goal,704,"7-year-old Annaston Cox of Altha, FL was born with a Congenital Heart
  Defect called Mitral Valve Prolapse with Insufficiency as well as
  Graves Disease. At the age of 3, she had her first open heart surgery
  to repair a valve, at Shands Children’s Hospital in Gainesville, FL.
  Just before she was taken back for surgery, Anna was given a shot of
  Ativan for separation anxiety, but within seconds she went limp and
  quit breathing. Anna had gone into anaphylactic shock and needed to be
  intubated. Thankfully Anna’s surgeons were able to stabilize her and
  proceed with repairing the valve. After surgery, Anna started gaining
  weight and truly living life to the fullest. She was just like any
  other child… she played t-ball, cheered for the county league football
  team, and competed with the Kitty Katz cheer competition squad up
  until March 2018 when everything changed. Last Winter, Anna started having severe headaches, high fevers,
  unexplained exhaustion, night sweats, and she refused to eat. She
  began to wake during the night screaming about head pain and became
  unable to walk or climb in or out of bed. Her parents, Ron and Tanya
  Cox, grew increasingly concerned and took Anna to her pediatrician
  several times. Blood was drawn twice a week for a month, along with
  frequent X-rays and CT scans but Anna’s doctors were stumped, saying
  it was either a blood disorder or autoimmune disease. Anna continued
  to suffer. At her wit's end, Tanya demanded answers, refusing to leave the
  pediatrician’s office until she got them. That same day, April 4,
  2018, Anna was admitted to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital where after
  even more testing they still had no definitive answers except that
  Anna might have an autoimmune disease, Meningitis or a bone marrow disorder. On April 7th, 2018, Anna was transferred by ambulance to the Cardiac
  ICU at Shand’s Children’s Hospital in Gainesville. A few hours after
  they arrived, the Cox were told that Anna had Infective Endocarditis;
  strep bacteria had entered her bloodstream and settled on her Mitral
  Valve. Anna was started on aggressive antibiotics, and numerous
  additional tests were run. When Anna’s eyes were checked, the doctor
  noticed that her optic nerves were swollen and her pupils didn’t react
  to light as they should, so an emergency MRI was ordered. While lying in the hospital bed comforting her daughter, a
    team of doctors came in and told Tanya that the MRI had shown
    several small blood clots on both sides of Anna’s brain and that she
    had already had a few “silent” strokes. The pressure from the blood
    clots explained why Anna’s optic nerves were swollen as well as her
    severe head pain. Then Tanya was told the devastating news that they
    had found an aneurysm on the back of her brain and in at that moment
    Tanya realized how truly sick Anna was and was heartbroken. Anna needed her infected valve replaced with a mechanical one, but
  the heart surgeon chose to wait because there was a strong chance of a
  major stroke if her aneurysm burst. Anna’s neurosurgeon was concerned
  because the bacteria was settled on the valve which was still
  producing blot clots. They knew any one of those clots could be fatal.
  The Cox were told without the heart valve replacement Anna would have
  a heart attack, but there was still a strong chance she could suffer a
  deadly stroke. Ronald and Tanya struggled with this decision for two
  weeks until a blot clot moved into Anna's lung and the decision was
  taken out of their hands. On May 1, 2018, Anna had open heart surgery, and her damaged heart
  valve was replaced with a mechanical valve. Thankfully the surgery
  went well, and the doctors were able to remove all the bacteria. In
  the days to follow, Anna was recovering so well that her doctors began
  discussing a discharge date to the step-down unit, but that all
  changed on May 5th, 2018 when Anna woke up around 3 am screaming for
  help. Tanya ran to the bedside and found Anna sitting straight up with
  her eyes fixed to the right and her arms and legs drawn up and rigid.
  Tanya's sweet daughter couldn't see and the head pain was unbearable. Tanya knew in her heart that Anna was having a stroke and just
    as the hospital staff rushed into the room, Anna went limp and quit
    breathing. After being stabilized, Anna had an emergency craniotomy to
  evacuate the hemorrhage that had caused the stroke. Because she had
  just had major heart surgery three days earlier, the neurosurgeon gave
  Anna 2% chance to live through the procedure. The Cox's were told that
  Anna would most likely never awaken following surgery because of the
  extensive damage to her brain. They said she would probably be in a
  coma and on a ventilator and have little to no quality of life. On June 11th, 2018, Anna was transferred to Brooks
    Rehabilitation for in-patient therapy but was discharged on June
    26th because she made little progress during her two weeks stay. So
    with no preparation and still waiting for Anna’s insurance to
    update, the Cox's brought their daughter home. The past two
  months have been emotionally, physically, and financially draining for
  Tanya, Ronald, and their three other children. They have had to travel
  roughly three hours each way from their home in Altha to Anna’s
  specialist, all with two-year-old Branson in toe. Ronald is the
  manager at Roadmart in Marianna, FL and while management has been very
  understanding, his frequent absences from work have had a negative
  impact on the family finances. Anna is almost three months post-surgery and still is unable to say
  any words, follow commands, or communicate. The neurosurgeon told the
  Cox family that sadly Anna’s overall long-term prognosis is poor, but
  Tanya and Ronald refuse to give up on their daughter. There are so
  many things that are needed for Anna that insurance has yet to approve
  or may not cover. The Cox's want to provide the best possible future
  for Anna, but without the necessary equipment, it has been
  challenging. What Anna really needs most is a wheelchair, a
    stander, and a special needs activity seat so she can do therapy at
    home as well as become more mobile. Also, at this time their
    insurance is not covering her tube feeding, so they have to cover
    the $800 a month cost of her supplies out of pocket as well. When Ride to Give read Anna story we knew we had to support
    Tanya and Ronald as they do their best to provide as bright a future
    as that can for their daughter. The funds we raise will
  help fill in the financial gaps while they await insurance decisions
  regarding Anna's equipment needs, her tube feeding supplies, and help
  cover the costs for now twice-weekly trip Gainesville to see Anna’s
  medical team. Please help Ride to Give as we support this sweet family
  by making a tax-deductible donation. You may follow Anna's journey by liking her Facebook page, Pray for Anna for updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the

"3,410",Everyone deserves the best possible chance of life,Pound Sterling,,of £10k goal,111,"We are raising funds for Love Hope Trust, a charity created to
  support people with cancer that require treatments not available
  through the NHS, and that can't afford to pay themselves. This charity was set up by the friends and family of Rachel Carrack,
  who in her early thirties, and with two young children, was diagnosed
  with inoperable pancreatic cancer. Rachel is currently accessing a new and effective type of treatment
  in Germany...however, there are others who aren't in such a position
  to access such treatment. Love Hope Trust aims to address this gap and

530,Fully Loaded Movement,U.S. Dollar,,of $500 goal,9,"Our names are Leslie Hoddevik and Macey Gándara. We are the PE
  teachers at Chehalem Elementary and we have way too much fun teaching
  our 500 wonderful students together. We often have ideas that involve using a projector screen. Due to the
  nature of our gym and stage situation, we are unable to use a
  projector set-up because the chords would be a tripping hazard to
  students. We also would like to use a projector during the morning
  times to get the kids moving several days a week before classes begin. Therefore a rear facing projector screen with an Apple TV hooked up
  to the projector would be an amazing addition to our Physical
  Education program as well as a helpful tool for the whole school to
  use every day.  We would have a projector set-up behind the rear
  screen on the stage so no chords would be on the gym floor. We have
  access to iPads that we would airplay through the Apple TV onto the
  screen. The possibilities are endless for a system like this in our gymnasium. We would greatly appreciate your help in funding our project and
  sharing it with your friends and family.  We look forward to all the
  benefits these learning tools will provide all students at Chehalem.
  We are excited to partner with you to accomplish our goals. Thank you
  for all you do to support student growth and learning. The money would be split for the two items needed: $350 for a rear facing projector screen $150 towards an Apple TV.",https://fundrazr.com/Fully_Loaded_Movement

  are the best investment. We support Escuela Proyecto La Esperanza (The
  School of Hope) in Jocotenango, Guatemala because of their ideals and
  accomplishments. In order to improve a population you need empowerment

  supporting a child whom faces countless socioeconomic and
  psychological barriers requires a holistic approach. What these
  children face on a near daily basis makes all of our life obstacles
  seem pity. The staff and volunteers here are committed. It's no secret that we
  hold teachers and social workers in the highest regard. The people
  here are an outstanding example of why we feel this way. They
  genuinely care and love the community in which they are improving.
  They sacrifice so much for others. This is a long term and sustainable
  commitment. They aren't going anywhere unless these socioeconomic

135,Cannabis Therapeutics Certification,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,7,"This year we are celebrating 15 years since the American
    Alliance for Medical Cannabis was founded. Dr. Jay Cavanaugh created
    AAMC to help patients and to educate health professionals, lawmakers
    and the general public about the therapeutic uses of Cannabis. We
    have come a long way since 2001. We now have AAMC Directors in 21
    States, and 26 States plus the District of Columbia have legal
    medical marijuana. The most common question patients ask is “Where can I find a
    doctor who can help me?” Most doctors have not had a chance to learn
    about medical cannabis. They didn’t learn about the endocannabinoid
    system in medical school and they are reluctant to talk about it. The American Alliance for Medical Cannabis is dedicated to
    helping patients. We need your support to increase our staff so that
    we can identify qualified health professionals and provide patients
    with quality medical care. By becoming AAMC certified clinics, health professionals will
    demonstrate that they are informed about the therapeutic use of
    Cannabis. AAMC is trusted by patients. We understand the needs of
    patients. Patients will know that they are being cared for by
    competent doctors. Patients have the right to talk about their use
    of Cannabis with people who know that it’s not just for fun. Our goal is to develop clinics where patients can get complete
    medical care from doctors who know how Cannabis helps. If you would
    like to help, please give AAMC a generous donation today. AAMC certified clinics provide: * Knowledgeable doctors and nurses * Cannabis is part of initial treatment plan when indicated. * Clinics are typical doctor's offices * Full service health care The goal is to develop clinics that have knowledgeable staff to
    deliver patient care.",https://fundrazr.com/MedicalCannabis
900,Chemonkey,U.S. Dollar,,of $25k goal,12,"Cancer is an illness that change the life of who is living
  it , and the people who is surround. Due to this pathology,
  the routine, habits and custom of the child and the family, are
  strongly altered. Chemonkey is a project for kids who are living chemotherapy process,
  during the investigation, we realized that there wasn't any
    guide that the parents could use to explain their kids what
  they were living or were about to live. This is a hard task to do,
  because they don't know how to do it and the proper words to use. The
  main aim of this project is to ensure the kid's emotional well-being,
  to improve his experience and also to prepare him, so that he can
  face, in a better way, all the process. Chemonkey works as a tool for explaining, by an optimistic way and
  with proper words, the treatment and the side effects of it. So kids
  could understand their illness. The main character of the book is a
  monkey, who already lived the treatment, it shares his experience and
  will be their new best friend, who will share all this time with them.
  It increases kid's well being and help them to say their feelings,
  what really matters during this time. (We tested the prototypes with three kids, in all of them
    increased their self esteem , some of them believed that if her monkey could do it, she could
    too. They became brave and stop cover their eyes because of the
    needles. Also, it helps to the parents, because kids reflected
    themselves in the monkey, so if the monkey wants to sleep, they are
    trying to say that they're tired, so that is really helpful for the
    parents to know the emotions of their child) Please consider giving a donation to this project, any amount will
  help. Whether you can give or not, please share this widely with
  friends on facebook, twitter, e-mail, or any other social media. The more people who see this project, more kids will be
  happy - developing physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and
  social strength in the kids who receive this kit. The monkey hangs in their neck and chest, so it protects their port.",https://fundrazr.com/chemonkey
"15,469",Ride to Give- Flash Ironman Fundraiser for Stephen,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,921,"On Sunday, September 24th Team Ride to Give and Team Boom will be participating in Ironman 70.3 Augusta in Augusta , GA Kevin Baxter 1130 Austin Marshall 101 Bill Halstead 102 Stacy Hughes Halstead Team Boom 4019 Larry Daniel Hughes Team Boom 4019 Crystal Condon Team Boom - 4019 David Nazaroff Ride To Give 3.0 4065 Sarah J. Keeney Ride To Give 3.0 4065 Kelly Meredith Ride To Give 3.0 4065 George Abrams 1108 Erik and Patty Heine of Oklahoma City, OK were excited to welcome
  their first child, a son Stephen, in 2007. After he was born, the
  Heines observed Stephen had broad thumbs and toes, which they found
  odd but endearing. He also had a LOT of hair! From birth, Stephen
  struggled with feeding which caused him to have trouble gaining
  weight. It was frustrating, but they chalked it up to reflux and enjoy
  their sweet new baby. As he grew, Stephen hit his milestones on time, but always at the
  late end of the ""normal"" range. When Stephen was nine months
  old, he had hernia surgery, which led to the discovery of a heart
  murmur and a kidney abnormality. Following surgery, Stephen's physical
  development stalled, and at one year old, he was referred for Early
  Intervention for therapies. There were still lingering
    questions about his health issues, and after additional testing,
    Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome in
    May of 2008. Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome , a
  genetic disorder which affects approximately 1:250,000 births, is
  characterized by short stature, moderate to severe intellectual
  disability, distinctive facial features, and broad thumbs and first
  toes. Additional features of the disorder can include eye
  abnormalities, heart and kidney defects, dental problems, and obesity.
  These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals. People with
  this condition have an increased risk of developing noncancerous and
  cancerous tumors, including certain kinds of brain tumors. Cancer of
  blood-forming tissue (leukemia) also occurs more frequently in people
  with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome. Infants born with this severe form of
  the disorder usually survive only into early childhood. Thankfully Stephen’s overall health has balanced out, and he
    is a happy and thriving 4th grader. Currently, Stephen receives private physical and occupational
  therapies, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy in
  his school setting.  To meet his goals of independence as an adult,
  Stephen spends approximately 3/4 of his school day with his typically
  developing peers, in the regular education classroom. Also, he has
  difficulty communicating verbally, so he uses Proloquo2Go software on an iPad
  mini to communicate. Doctors have not given the Heines a timeline as to what they should
  expect with Stephen, so they take everything one day at a time.
  They're determined to not let their child's disability or illness keep
  them from doing the things they love and find a way to adapt and make
  that activity possible. Erik is an avid runner, and for years it has
  been an activity he can share with Stephen. Up until recently, they
  have been able to use a traditional running stroller which Stephen has
  now out grown and is not 100% safe for him. After much research, Eric
  found the Blade at www.hoytrunningchairs.com . Hoyt Running Chairs designs and
    manufactures state-of-the-art racing chairs for individuals with
    disabilities. As a subdivision of Southbridge Tool &
    Manufacturing , they are able to custom build each chair to the
    comfort and needs of both the rider and the runner. They pride
    themselves on getting to know their clients and providing them with
    the ultimate racing experience. Mike Didonato , the president of Southbridge
    Tool & Manufacturing first heard the story of Rick and Dick Hoyt in 2009. Dick Hoyt has pushed his son Rick,
      who was diagnosed a spastic quadriplegic with cerebral palsy after
      his birth in 1962, in over 1,000 races including marathons,
      triathlons, and 6 Ironman races. Their story inspired Mike,
    and a few months later he happened to meet Dick Hoyt at a local
    grocery store. Mike mentioned his family’s manufacturing company and
    offered to fix Rick’s chair if needed. The next year, Dick Hoyt
    showed up at Southbridge Tool and Manufacturing and asked if a brand
    new chair could be built for Rick because he was very uncomfortable
    in his original chair. The Signature was built in time for the Hoyts to compete in the 2010 Boston Marathon . The chair was
    beautifully built for comfort, speed, and maneuverability. Soon,
    other teams and families began asking for a chair. In 2014, Mike was
    approached by Nick Sotar , a retired bicycle shop owner, who
    admired The Signature but had some ideas to improve the design. Nick
    presented Mike with a design for a revolutionary new racing chair
    called The Blade , which is easily
    disassembled and can be shipped in a bike box. After Stephen was diagnosed with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome at 18
  months old, it took almost seven years before they were able to get
  him on non-income-based Medicaid. As a result, the Heines ate through
  their entire family savings paying for medical bills and therapies
  even with insurance. Unfortunately, the cost of a Blade racing
    wheelchair is approximately 10% of Erik’s gross annual
  salary as a Professor of Music at Oklahoma City University ,
  and not something they have sitting around or in a savings account.
  The Blade has not been deemed ""essential"" by their
  insurance. However, Stephen's Occupational and Physical Therapists
  both believe that a chair that he can use for over a decade IS
  essential to helping him relieve stress and participate in an outdoor
  activity like his typically-developing peers. Ride to Give agrees and wants to provide Stephen with a custom
    built Blade that will fit him perfectly and will be used for years
    to come. Our mission at RTG is to turn athletic ability into
  fundraising power for families with children who are disabled,
  injured, or ill.  We think Stephen and Erik will make fantastic
  ambassadors for Team Ride to Give and we can’t wait to see them race
  for the first time with their new Hoyt Running Chair . Please help us purchase the
  Blade running chair and accessories for Stephen by making a tax
  deductible donation to Ride to Give. At this time, Stephen does not have a Facebook Page of his
    own, so follow Ride to GIve on Facebook for all updates. Contributions are solicited with the understanding that the

    British Gut Project, have pivoted to COVID-19 research, and have
    revised our kits to support this effort. We are working as hard as
    we can, but please be patient as these changes have required a
    complete overhaul of our infrastructure. If you are interested in
    these kits, please fill out this sign up form and we will be sending
    you updates on kit availability : https://mailchi.mp/ucsd/microsettakitinterest We are in urgent need of funding to support these research
    endeavors. We are part of the UC San Diego School of Medicine. We

    resources, and engaged with the broader San Diego research network
    studying all aspects of this virus and disease. Please consider
    making a donation directly: https://go.ucsd.edu/2QlTi8n More information about these recent changes can be found in the UC
  San Diego News: https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/call-for-citizen-scientists-to-contribute-to-covid-19-studies ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a unique, open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and
  analyzed. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab about every 2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once
  your sample arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), processing takes 3-4
    months. We estimate that the whole process will take about
    4-6 months. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized
  interpretation . Results are uploaded via our
  participant website, which you will get access to once you register
  your kit. It will take longer than the expected 4-6 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome. Note your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the British Gut Project help
      account ( info@britishgut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that
    the Fundrazr transaction fee will be deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you
      must agree to use an electronic format for your signature in
      accordance with the United States' eSIGN Act and California's UETA

"4,801",Help Leewana heal -- get her back in action!,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.5k goal,104,"I must fight with all my strength so that the little positive
      things that my health allows me to do might be pointed toward
      helping the revolution. The only real reason for living. - Frida Kahlo *** Hey there! Wow. I didn’t realize how difficult this would be to write. I
    believe that we strengthen our communities and fight tyranny when we
    lift each other up. But it’s still not easy to admit that while I am
    fortunate and privileged in so many ways, I, Leewana, your friend,
    comrade, and co-conspirator, have a debilitating health condition.
    It’s even harder to add that because I want so desperately to be
    back in the trenches with you, I’m asking for your help. Ack, vulnerability! What’s going on? In case you don’t want to read the whole story... I have been
      suffering from debilitating migraines for the last year and would
      appreciate any help you can offer. You can donate once now, or
      choose a recurring donation that will last ONLY for the next four months . I have
      no preference, it's whatever works for you. If you want more detail, read on! For a little over a year, I’ve had a migraine almost every day. I started getting periodic migraines when I was 13 -- not fun,
    but manageable. Then last May, I flew backwards on a bus and got a
    concussion. My doctors think that it “triggered my pain systems,”
    and are hard at work to identify possible underlying conditions. All I know for sure is that it changed everything. Because migraines aren’t “visible,” it can be easy to diminish
    their impact. But the World Health Organization rates them as the 6th most debilitating health condition overall, and they take top honors among neurological conditions. This is a useful article about
      the full impact of migraine, from mental fuzziness to excruciating pain. For me, some days it’s “just” a headache. Those are among the
    days that I might be able to muster up energy to socialize or go to
    a meeting. But too often, my head throbs, I can’t stand, I feel dizzy,
    I’m nauseous, and all I can do is lie down in a dark room. In my darkest moments, it feels like migraines have completely
    taken over my life, and I doubt whether I’ll be able to do things
    like exercise, work full time, or socialize in groups ever again. I
    don’t think it’s a coincidence that migraines are strongly linked to
    depression and other mood disorders. I’ve become another medical debt sob story. In the initial aftermath of my concussion, I never imagined that
    I would still be in chronic pain over a year later. And when I was
    forced to stop working altogether in January, I had no idea that
    solving my headaches could take this much time, energy, and resources. I’ve tried remedies across the spectrum of Eastern and Western
    medicine, from acupuncture to magnesium to Botox. Unfortunately
    since the scientific community knows so little about migraines, most
    treatment plans are based on trial and error. By committing to put the necessary effort into feeling better,
    I’ve taken on a crippling amount of medical debt. Oh, the places I’d go without migraines holding me back. My medical debt is suffocating. But the hardest part of this
    ordeal is being forced to sit still for days, weeks, and months when
    there is so much work to do. I’m happy when I’m dancing with dear
    friends. I’m happy when I have enough energy to support my loved
    ones like they deserve. I am happiest fighting for a better world alongside all of you. I’ve been fortunate throughout the years to be surrounded by
    inspiring visionaries and doers. Over and over I’ve seen that righteously angry people can hack away at the seemingly inescapable power of the big banks, retail
    giants, a white supremacist government, and anything else they throw
    at us. I never dreamed that I would be forced to take such tremendous
    steps back from my work in the movement , from close friends, and also from many of the simple pleasures
    I enjoy in life. It’s been discouraging, but I am holding out hope
    that I can feel enough like myself again to get back to imagining
    and creating a more hopeful future for all of us. I am DETERMINED to get better. Like Frida, a fellow chronic pain sufferer, I am going to “ fight with all my strength” so that what “my health allows me to
    do might be pointed toward helping the revolution.” I’ve been trying
    to stay engaged in the struggle in small ways, and over the next few
    weeks I’m going to experiment with reconnecting with the work in a
    more part-time capacity. I hope that my contributions can get bigger
    and bigger as I continue treatment. A nd once I’m back, I intend to fight so that nobody else has to have the
      experience of choosing between financial security and health. There is some good news… In the past two months, I’ve developed a relationship with a
    leading neurologist and researcher at Mayo Clinic. It’s been refreshing to experience Mayo’s model of integrative
    health, and talk to doctors who can actually give me the time I
    need. With their support, I’m hoping to continue experimenting with
    new and unusual remedies to see what offers relief. Among these are CGRP inhibitor shots, Trigeminal Nerve devices,
    and transcranial magnetic stimulation. It’s too early for me to give
    out too much information without jinxing it… but Mayo doctors may
    have also found an underlying condition making my headaches worse.
    Fingers crossed! And now for the hard part … going beyond typical methods (which
    haven’t worked for me), and visiting top-notch medical institutions
    (when others can’t give me what I need) costs a lot of money. I’m
    lucky to have gotten support from my family, but we are at the end
    of our means. In order to continue down these treatment paths, and
    hopefully ultimately get relief, I need some kind of miracle. That’s why I’m reaching out to my beloved community. Because of insurance compatibility issues, the CGRP-inhibitor
    shot costs $650 per month. A “Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation” or
    “Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation” Device totals around $500, or
    $250 / month, depending on which I use. Continued visits to Mayo
    Clinic cost $400 - $500 each. And as mentioned above, I’ve
    accumulated thousands in medical debt over the last year. I’m not asking to cover my living costs, or even my entire
    medical costs. But any small dent you can help put in this sum,
    which totals from $800 - $1500 per month, is deeply felt. You can either donate in one chunk, or choose the option
        to spread it out over the next 4 months. All donations will go directly towards the medical costs I
    outlined above, or towards paying off prior medical debt. I am
    making it possible to donate on a recurring basis because some
    friends shared that they would like the option to spread out their
    donation over a few months... Do whatever feels best to you! My goal is to use this boost to dive into new treatments,
    and level out my costs as I discover what works. I will keep you
    consistently updated, and you can rescind a donation at any time. Without your help, I’m stuck, but with it, I know that I can
    continue on my path towards healing. Thank you. One thing I have taken away from this ordeal is a consistent
    gratitude practice. Even if I haven’t spoken to you in a while,
    chances are I’m thinking of you often as I consider circumstances,
    experiences, and people for which I am thankful. You’ve taught me the power of compassionate acts, and I hope
    you know that the next time you’re in need I want to be the first
    person you approach for support. Thank you for reading this far and for considering my requests,
    even as there are infinite worthy causes. Please don’t hesitate to
    contact me with questions, comments, poetry, kind words, etc :)
    Peace, love, & solidarity forever!",https://fundrazr.com/helpleewana
"2,800",Help me stay #unstoppable with an Alinker walking bike!,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,21,"My name is Julia and even though I was born with cerebral palsy it
  is not usually a way I ever describe myself. Growing up I did not put
  limits on myself and what I could or could not do. I always tried if
  it was something I wanted to do I tried and tried again. Sometimes it
  didn’t work out but most times, I could figure out a way to get things
  done. As I’ve become an adult I’m not as strong as I once was, but I
  have yet to give up my “unstoppable” spirit. Throughout the years I
  have found different ways to help myself stay independent and mobile.
  These have included surgeries, and therapy, a wheelchair, and my
  greatest blessing; a beautiful Mobility service dog named Hope. Read more about Hope and I
    here Although these have all been things that have changed my life for the
  better,  I still struggle with daily tasks. One of the best things
  about my wheelchair is that I can get out and go places without
  overexerting myself, but one of the worst things about my wheelchair
  is, I still need to ask for assistance more often than I would like
  because things are often out of reach  and I do worry that I am losing
  what little strength I do have in my legs when using my chair.  The
  day I was browsing online and an ad for the Alinker walking bike came
  up I thought to myself that is really cool and I shared it so other
  people could see it too, but  when I went back and started reading
  about it I realized that not only would it be good for other people,
  But it could be an excellent tool for ME! Not only would I be more
  upright and able to do more things on my own I would also be able to
  stay active and use my legs without completely exhausting myself.
  Since I’ve been keeping up with the Alinker, I’ve noticed one really
  interesting thing when you see it out somewhere , you don’t
  immediately think oh look a poor disabled person but rather oh that’s
  cool I wonder where they got it? I would like to thank anyone who is
  considering making a donation to any of the #Alinker campaigns and
  helping everyone with their  continuing mobility and independence ! # Independence #alinker #alinkerwalkingbike #letsroll #keepmoving

  the doctors and staff of Emerald Park Eye Care (EPEC) and we are
  committed to caring for the eye health of those in the community. We
  are especially excited to raise money for Optometry Giving Sight and
  expanding our reach to less-fortunate people around the world. And, we
  are SO EXCITED to raise funds in this format - we love games and challenges!!! Optometry Giving Sight is a charity that provides eye exams and
  glasses for people who do not otherwise have access to care. Their
  slogan is ""transforming lives through the gift of vision"" -
  and we can't think of a more worthy cause!  Each year we participate
  in their fundraising campaign in October (Vision Health Month), and
  thought that this year we would enhance our efforts and do some early
  fundraising in August as well! We are lucky enough to see every day what a difference eye exams and
  glasses can make for our patients, and being able to spread this
  privilege throughout the world is truly a gift. Imagine a world
  without glasses - many children and adults throughout the world don't
  have to imagine it as it is their reality. The funds raised by this
  charity truly make a difference. Please donate to our EPEC team and this very worthy cause! Thanks! Team EPEC",https://fundrazr.com/31XUGd
"2,850",Please help me #keepmoving #outdoors with an #Alinker Walking Bike.,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,39,"Hi! I’m David. Please help me #keepmoving outdoors with an #Alinker
  Walking Bike. I'm a single Dad and would love to be able to enjoy the
  outdoors again with my daughter and friends. Diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at age 2, I spent most of my
  youth in and out of a wheelchair and in and out of hospitals. After
  many years and total joint replacements in both hips and knees, I
  became more mobile and began participating in outdoor activities with
  the assistance of several local non-profit groups that assist the
  disabled in the participation of sports such as hiking, kayaking,
  sailing and more. However, in early 2018, I had to have a second knee replacement (on
  the same knee) and later that year, I fell and since then, I have not
  been able to walk without assistance.  I currently use crutches
  outside and a walker in the home.  I have not participated in any
  outdoor activities for over a year. I no longer go for walks, regular
  grocery shopping, go to malls or other public venues.  Walking with
  crutches while having Rheumatoid Arthritis causes added pain in my
  back, neck and shoulders.  This pain along with an overall fear of
  falling prevents me from going out, enjoying the great outdoors in New
  England and being socially active as I had been before the knee
  replacement and subsequent fall. I attend Physical Therapy several
  days a week and am trying to get some strength back. The #Alinker is a three-wheeled walking bike designed to help people
  stay active and live life to the fullest allowing users experience
  chronic aches and pains, chronic illnesses and recovering from an
  injury, they can all still be active! Currently, Health Insurance
  plans do not cover a very broad range of mobility devices and that’s
  why campaigns like this are so important. I'd be able to rebuild and
  maintain muscle tone in my legs, be able to walk upright instead of
  using all my energy focusing on trying not to fall and once again
  enjoy my time outdoors and with family and friends without the feeling
  like I'm slowing everyone down. It may even allow me to return to
  scuba diving as I'd be able to use the #Alinker to walk the trail down
  to the water's edge at Ft. Wetherill park in Jamestown, RI.  to It
  really would give me so much freedom back, open up my world again, and
  change my life. To learn more about my life’s journey, please visit me
  at davidstmartin.com . Thank you for your consideration and support.",https://fundrazr.com/71YCU4

  The Alinker is my ticket to inclusion, mobility, fitness & independence. When I am unstable mobility wise (in a flare) I feel vulnerable and
  nervous to go out. The Alinker will change that for me. The Alinker is definitely the right choice for my lifestyle. It’s a humbling experience asking for financial support. Helping to
  purchase the Alinker Is exactly what I’m asking support for. Currently Medical plans do not cover a very broad range of mobility

"1,952",Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500k goal,28,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1
"1,944,028",American Gut,,,,,"We are currently not able to supply any of our regular
    collection kits. The Microsetta Initiative and its
  subsidiaries, including the American Gut Project, have pivoted to
  COVID-19 research and are revising our kits to support this effort. We
  are working as hard as we can, but please be patient as these changes
  have required a complete overhaul of our infrastructure.  If you are
  interested in these kits, please fill out this sign up form and we
  will be sending you updates on kit availability : https://mailchi.mp/ucsd/microsettakitinterest In addition, we are in urgent need of funding to support these
    research endeavors. We are part of the UC San Diego School of
    Medicine. We are actively working with frontline workers, sharing
    limited resources, and engaged with the broader San Diego research
    network studying all aspects of this virus and disease. Please
    consider making a donation directly: https://go.ucsd.edu/2QlTi8n More information about these recent changes
  can be found in the UC San Diego News: https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/call-for-citizen-scientists-to-contribute-to-covid-19-studies ____________________________________________________________________________________________ The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with the mission of
    collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data from
    populations across the globe. The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if
    you would like to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed
    as a perk, email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS or FedEx within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go
      out. If you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit
      will not be sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere Else: International participants are also welcome to join. An
    additional $25 international shipping fee also
    applies (which you would add as an additional contribution
  after claiming a perk), along with other regulations . I f you
    do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be sent out
    until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in
  the U.S. from some locations can be expensive , so it is
    recommended that you look into the cost of return shipping (it is
    highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes significantly longer (6+ months)
      to receive results if you submit one of the following sample
      types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that
    the Fundrazr transaction fee will be deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you
      must agree to use an electronic format for your signature in
